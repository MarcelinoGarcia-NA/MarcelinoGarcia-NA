Hello! I'm Marcelino Garcia, an experienced professional in the field of software development. My journey began with a degree in Computer Science, and since then, I have been actively contributing to the world of technology.

With over 5 years of experience, a significant portion of my career was spent in the pharmaceutical industry, where I applied my skills and knowledge to tackle complex challenges. However, my relentless pursuit of improvement and innovation led me to earn a degree in Technology in Analysis and Systems Development.

Currently, my commitment is to continuous learning and technical excellence. I have expertise in various technologies, including Next.js, React.js, Vue.js, TypeScript, Node.js, among others. My approach is guided by the quest for excellence, without the need to be the best in every area.

I am always open to new challenges and collaboration opportunities. If you are seeking a dedicated professional with strong technical knowledge and a passion for software development, I am available to contribute to innovative projects. Let's connect and explore new possibilities!
