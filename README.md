The formation of Technician in Computer Science, propelled me in this magnificent world of programming. For about 5 years I worked hard in the pharmaceutical industry, I can say, I was happy with my job, but my technology essence would guide me to the degree in Technology in Systems Analysis and Development. My reality today is to learn as much as possible, manage my time, understand my past and make improvements in the future. I have knowledge in some technologies, such as HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, C, React.Js, Node.js, Mysql, MongoDB among others, however my main skill is always wanting to do the best, without necessarily being the best.
